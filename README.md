In this project presented by Novartis during their 2019 Academia to Industry Quantitative Sciences Hackathon, I

Compare Support Vector Machine with Recursive Feature Elemination(SVM-RFE) with a modified version of SVM-RFE with t-statistic(SVM-T-Statistic) to identify and classify proteins from SOMAscan that are most predictive of weight loss in obese monkeys.

Achieved higher classification accuracy with SVM-T-RFE method at dose 0.1mg/ml

Identified top proteins for classification using both methods
